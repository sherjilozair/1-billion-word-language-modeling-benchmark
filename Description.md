Language Modeling Benchmark

The purpose of the project is to make available a standard training and test setup for language modeling experiments, as well as baseline N-gram model results on this data set.

The training/held-out data was produced from a download at statmt.org using a combination of Bash shell and Perl scripts.

This also means that your results on this data set are reproducible by the research community at large.

Happy Benchmarking!
